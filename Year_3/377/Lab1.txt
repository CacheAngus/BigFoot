//pseudo code
int isProcessDir(constr struct dirent* d){
	if the d->d_name returns a digit, then it returns 1 if the first character of the directory name is a digit. 
	If not it returns a 0.
}

int main(){
create a double pointer namelist to the struct array dirent
int n for scandir storage
int i for iteration.

There needs to be buffers for both opening the files in the directories and for getting the 
data names:
char <name of attribute>[100]

File pointer for file opening and storage.

Use scandir to store the running processes in namelist with a isProcessDir filter
 and then return the amount in n.

for i 0 to n, iterate by 1 through namelist
	string print the directory "/proc/(directory name)/status"
	file open to read, store in buffer string1
	scan the file line by line and store wanted values in named buffers and all unwanted in temp buffer
	print the wanted values in a single line
	close the file
	iterate through the next directory file

return 0 for the main
}
